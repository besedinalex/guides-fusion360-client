# Beginner's guides to Fusion 360

This small web site was created for very beginners (especially pupils) who have never worked with [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview). Content of the site was made by students of [Moscow Polytechnic University](https://mospolytech.ru).

Every guide may have different quality and usefulness depending on who exactly made the one.

This site is the new version of an [old project](https://github.com/BesedinAlex/guides-fusion360-old) which was abandoned due to some reasons. It also uses data from server, that is developed in [separate repository](https://github.com/BesedinAlex/guides-fusion360-server).

## Basic stuff

The site is made with [React](https://reactjs.org) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Also [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is used for visual stuff and [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for 3D viewer.

### Setup

Install Node.js from their [site](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Run `npm i typescript -g` to get TypeScript.

Make sure that your CLI now handles `node`, `npm`, `tsc` commands.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
